The legislation, traditionally renewed every five years, deals with agriculture policy in the U.S., from green environmental efforts to the annual federal aid Robbins receives. The combine was a quarter-million-dollar investment, but Robbins was able to pay for it entirely in cash thanks to government assistance and years of consistent profit, he says.

						<p>To most, Robbins seems like a typical recipient of Farm Bill funding. His occupation matches the bill’s title after all. What might not be as apparent, though, is that the funding farmers like him receive accounts for just 23 percent of the bill. The Farm Bill isn’t all about farms.</p>
						<p>A legislative battle is brewing over the other 77 percent: nutrition programs. Last summer, the House of Representatives proposed and passed a $39 billion cut to the largest chunk of nutrition funding, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps. It’s a decision that is radically threatening a long-standing and unlikely union between agriculture subsidies and food aid. For decades, the bill, expected to be finalized by Congress in January, has connected farmers and SNAP recipients by one common thread: political survival.</p>

						<p>The Farm Bill grew out of an era of economic collapse. The U.S. was in the thick of the Great Depression after World War I, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed the New Deal, a series of economic programs aimed at boosting and stabilizing a ruined economy. The Agricultural Adjustment Act, which would later become the Farm Bill, was one of the hallmark New Deal programs when it passed in 1933, and it provided farmers income supports.</p>

						<p>"The rural economy was seen as an agricultural economy at that point,” says Anne Effland, a farm policy specialist with the United States Department of Agriculture. "If the farm economy is healthy, then the rural economy will be healthy, and the national economy will be healthy.”</p>
						<p>The nutrition portion, which now accounts for $209 billion of the Farm Bill, wasn’t always a part of the legislation, though. Nutrition programs have existed since the New Deal, but rapid inflation and increased urbanization led more Americans to turn to federal nutrition assistance in the 1970s.</p>

						<p>At the same time, a shrinking rural population lacked enough political power to pass agricultural programs, according to Effland. Not wanting their farming constituents’ interests to go unserved, politicians from agricultural districts sought out urban political allies as a kind of safety net, and a new Farm Bill was born.</p>
						<p>Both nutrition and agriculture policymakers needed more votes to maintain funding for their respective programs. "It was added out of survival,” says Harrison Pittman, director of the National Agricultural Law Center, a federally funded law research and information center. "The Food Stamp lobbyists and the Farm Bill lobbyists cut a deal.”</p>

						<p>"Historically, [the Farm Bill has] been pretty much a bipartisan affair and not that controversial, and they've been able to get through the Congress pretty well,” Pittman says.</p>
						<p>Today, the Farm Bill still funds agricultural programs and SNAP. The most recent iteration of the bill, known as the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, upheld some of the same agricultural safety-net policies as its predecessors. The government seemed to pass the Farm Bill almost automatically since its inception, but now, for the first time, the Farm Bill is at a standstill. "They've gotten more and more difficult to pass, but pretty much, you can make an easy argument that this one is the most contentious,” Pittman says. At issue is $39 billion in cuts to SNAP proposed by the House of Representatives while the Senate version of the bill cuts much less.</p>
						<p>In the 2008 Farm Bill, funding for agricultural policy composes just $60 billion of the $307 billion budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Farmers make up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population, compared with 21.5 percent in the 1930s, according to the USDA. But the number of SNAP recipients continues to grow. Currently, 15 percent, or nearly 47 million, of the U.S. population uses federal nutrition assistance &mdash; more than ever before.</p>

						<p>Given his can-do attitude, it’s not surprising Kestel would embrace the challenge of running a farm by himself. He’s got an old school streak in him, and the few thousand dollars he gets annually in direct payments and crop insurance from the Farm Bill, he could take or leave. "Our input costs have gotten staggeringly high,” Kestel says. "So $8,000 [in subsidies], I mean, yeah, okay, it’s nice. But in the grand scheme of things, it don’t amount to squat.”</p>

						<p>While politicians stall the bill, the nutrition program continues to receive funding because it is permanent legislation.

						<p>For the House, attempting to split the bill is the first move in an effort to further cut nutrition assistance programs. Many conservatives believe such programs are better supported through churches and donations, not the federal government, Pittman says.

						<p>The House’s proposed Nutrition Reform Act includes a number of cost-cutting measures.It would prevent the USDA and U.S. from advertising or promoting SNAP; implement an income test for SNAP recipients; reduce "waste, fraud and abuse” by ending benefits for lottery winners and college students; and increase oversight of nutrition programs for the homeless, elderly, and disabled.</p>

"People who maybe have two jobs or three jobs, people who are married and have children, who have maybe been laid off or have had to stop working because they’ve gone on disability.”</p>

If that net is cut, if SNAP is cut at all, there will not be enough private resources to fill that gap.”</p>
						<p>Stas, who works from home as an independent contractor for a marketing company, eats a chicken salad croissant on her way to the gas station in preparation for her trip.  She uses $5 in change to put money in her empty tank and holds up the gas hose to get every last drop.</p>

						<p>Stas uses four different pantries total. She hasn’t visited the pantry in Skokie in a while. "So three right now,” she says.
