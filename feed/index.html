						<p>To most, Robbins seems like a typical recipient of Farm Bill funding. His occupation matches the bill’s title after all. What might not be as apparent, though, is that the funding farmers like him receive accounts for just 23 percent of the bill. The Farm Bill isn’t all about farms. </p>
						<p>A legislative battle is brewing over the other 77 percent: nutrition programs. Last summer, the House of Representatives proposed and passed a $39 billion cut to the largest chunk of nutrition funding, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps. It’s a decision that is radically threatening a long-standing and unlikely union. For decades, the bill has connected farmers and SNAP recipients by one common thread: political survival. </p>

						<p>The Farm Bill grew out of an era of economic collapse. The U.S. was in the thick of the Great Depression after World War I, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed the New Deal, a series of economic programs aimed at boosting and stabilizing a ruined economy. The Agricultural Adjustment Act, which would later become the Farm Bill, was one of the hallmark New Deal programs when it passed in 1933. The bill provided farmers income supports.</p>

						<p>“The rural economy was seen as an agricultural economy at that point,” says Anne Effland, a farm policy specialist with the United States Department of Agriculture. “If the farm economy is healthy, then the rural economy will be healthy, and the national economy will be healthy.”</p>
						<p>The nutrition portion, which now accounts for $209 billion of the Farm Bill, wasn’t always a part of the legislation, though. Nutrition programs have existed since the New Deal, but rapid inflation and increased urbanization led more Americans to turn to federal nutrition assistance in the 1970s.</p>

						<p>At the same time, a shrinking rural population lacked enough political power to pass agricultural programs, according to Effland. Not wanting their farming constituents’ interests to go unserved, politicians from agricultural districts sought out urban political allies as a kind of safety net, and a new Farm Bill was born.</p>
						<p>Both nutrition and agriculture policymakers needed more votes to maintain funding for their respective programs. “It was added out of survival,” says Harrison Pittman, director of the National Agricultural Law Center. “The food stamp program realized it was under attack, and they realized there was going to be a Farm Bill [up for renewal]. So the Food Stamp lobbyists and the Farm Bill lobbyists cut a deal.” </p>

						<p>Today, the Farm Bill still funds agricultural programs and SNAP. The most recent iteration of the bill, known as the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, upheld some of the same agricultural safety-net policies as its predecessors. The government seemed to pass the Farm Bill almost automatically since its inception, but now, for the first time, the Farm Bill is at a standstill, its future unclear. </p>

But the number of SNAP recipients continues to grow. Currently, 15 percent, or 47.6 million, of the U.S. population uses federal nutrition assistance -- more than ever before.

Her government assistance was not enough to cover the $800 monthly cost to feed herself, her husband and her children. “There’s never enough to get by,” she says. “I’m not sure what they are basing it on, whether it’s yearly or monthly or… All I know is that it’s not enough to feed a family of six.”</p>

						<p>For the House, attempting to split the bill is the first move in an effort to further cut nutrition assistance programs. Many conservatives believe such programs are better supported through churches and donations, not the federal government, Pittman says. “There’s a clear intent to split [the bill] out, you know, and conquer and divide.”</p>
						<p>The House’s proposed Nutrition Reform Act includes a number of cost-cutting measures.It would prevent the USDA and states from advertising or promoting SNAP; implement an income test for SNAP recipients; reduce “waste, fraud and abuse” by ending benefits for lottery winners and college students; and increase oversight of nutrition programs for the homeless, elderly, and disabled. “The nutrition community would be over a barrel big time,” Pittman says.</p>
						<p>For the most part, the Republican-led House is in the farmer’s corner, but while they fight to defund nutrition programs, they are faced with not just a strong Democrat opposition in the Senate but also a waning agricultural voting bloc. </p>

You're going to start losing air and going towards the ground, and hopefully you don't die when you hit the bottom.”</p>

						<p>A pair of sunglasses holds back Stas’s wavy hair. She wears rectangular-shaped eyeglasses and another pair of glasses hangs from her sun visor, all of which she interchanges as she drives home to drop off her first round of groceries.</p>
						<p>At just around 5 p.m., she arrives at her mother’s two-story house in Skokie, Ill., where Stas pays rent. The suburban neighborhood doesn’t fit the profile of a person struggling with food insecurity.“No, you don’t think about it in this area at all. No way,” Stas says. “And there are beautiful homes here. Who would think anyone’s having a problem? … And at first, sure I cried at food pantries. Not anymore.”</p>
						<p>Paul Morello, public relations coordinator at the Greater Chicago Food Depository, which distributes food to pantries across Cook County, says there is no typical family that needs assistance. “Increasingly we are seeing people who have jobs coming to food pantries, soup kitchens and shelters,” he says. “People who maybe have two jobs or three jobs, people who are married and have children, who have maybe been laid off or have had to stop working because they’ve gone on disability.”</p>
						<p>Food insecurity is widespread. There are 860,000 people in the Chicago area alone who are food insecure. That’s one out of six people -- a staggering statistic, Morello says. “People are unsure where they’re going to eat, and any cut to the SNAP program, to the federal nutrition safety net, is going to impact that.”</p>

						<p>Food aid organizations are not prepared for any large reductions to the government’s food program, Morello says. “SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger for many people. That federal nutrition safety net is critical to so many individuals being able to feed their families. If that net is cut, if SNAP is cut at all, there will not be enough private resources to fill that gap.”</p>
						<p>Stas, who works from home as an independant contractor for a marketing company, eats a chicken salad croissant on her way to the gas station in preparation for her trip.  She uses $5 in change to put money in her empty tank and holds up the gas hose to get every last drop.</p>
						<p>“There’s still gas in the hose after you fill up, and it drops back so I open up the nozzle, and I let it flow into my car,” she says. “Otherwise the next person will get it, and it’s mine because I paid for it,” adding a husky chuckle.</p>
						<p>Stas uses four different pantries total. She hasn’t visited the pantry in Skokie in a while. “So three right now,” she says. She goes to the Robert Crown Center, also in Evanston, the second Tuesday of each month. “But they have cut back on what they offer,” she says. “Maybe two bags full, when it used to be a whole cart full.”</p>
						<p>After a cigarette break, Stas finally leaves for Barrington at about half past five. “Barrington gives you an extreme amount of food, a whole cart full, approximately six to eight meats, dairy products. It’s a massive amount that can set me for the whole month. So it definitely balances out,” she says. “And when I miss it, it hurts.”</p>

						<p>Guth is concerned because more and more families are coming to the center from outside of Barrington, and they’re having to turn people away. Even though unemployment rates are lowering and people are getting jobs, the number of patrons has increased, Guth says. “We’re open 11 shifts throughout the week, and every single shift is packed like this. We serve over 5,000 families a month.”</p>
						<p>Stas tells Guth her SNAP benefits have been cut.</p>
						<p>“You have $20 a month? Wow,” Guth says. “Thank God that there’s pantries out there that are making up for it.”</p>
						<p>Stas changes the subject, telling Guth there is a chance her mother might sell her house. “If I have to go to a shelter, I will, but I don’t want to. I’ll go to the YMCA and maybe live with a friend or something.”</p>
