                    Karl S. Matlin, Ph.D., is a leading researcher at one of the country’s top medical institutions. As a professor of surgery and vice chairman of research at the University of Chicago, he oversees the development of numerous projects in cell biology, he mentors young students in the study of medical research, and he provides support for graduates who are in the final stages of pursuing their scientific careers.
                </p>
                <p>Currently, Matlin’s lab focuses on how cells maintain polarity, an aspect not understood by many scientists. This research allows him and his students to study a cell’s different functions, which helps them to develop new treatment methods that could replace the need for undergoing surgery. While private grants fund his research and supplies, Matlin relies on government funding to not only pay his salary, but also those of his technicians, postdoctoral students and graduate students. A typical grant from the National Institutes of Health would provide his lab support for 4 to 5 years, while paying out an annual amount of $250,000.</p>
                <p>
                    But in the past year, Matlin has seen two out of three of his labs close. He’s seen his funding dwindle, having been denied a grant from the NIH that has cost him as much as $300,000. He’s watched as many as seven knowledgeable colleagues with 15 to 20 years of concentrated and specialized training lose their jobs, causing them to leave the field of research permanently. All of these factors are contributing to the harsh message he now delivers to young scientists who aspire to pursue medical research in America: “This is no longer a desirable profession.”
                </p>
                <p>Federal funding is both a gift and a curse. It has sustained medical research by providing researchers the means to study the basic science necessary for everything from innovations in surgery to the production of vaccines for the common flu. It is also responsible for allowing labs like Matlin’s to study treatments for life-threatening injuries, such as the reduction of blood flow to kidneys after surgery. But thanks to government cuts in the last five years, medical research now stands in danger, and federal funding has become a roadblock for scientists and researchers alike as they struggle to develop new treatments and technologies.

                    That compromise never occurred. Instead, Congress let $85 billion worth of cuts take effect in 2013. These cuts will total $1.2 trillion until at least 2021. Unless Congress passes a new budget that the president signs, the amount slashed each year will continue to grow.

                <p>The National Institute of Health is just one of the many institutions losing a large part of its financing, and its losses are significant. Last March, the organization received the news that it would lose $1.6 billion from its total 2013 budget of $30.8 billion.</p>

                    The NIH’s budget has been reduced almost seven percent since 2010, when it once totaled $31.2 billion. Today’s reduced budget means fewer scientists are able to acquire the funding they need to support their research.

                    Dr. Steve Farmer, a clinical researcher at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, says these cuts are devastating to medical research. “The NIH is a major avenue for research grants, but due to the sequester, it awards only 6 percent of research applications, down from 10 percent pre-sequester,” he explains. According to NIH data, the success rate in grants for 2012 was 18 percent, down 13 percentage points from a decade ago. This is not due to a lack of applications: That number was up by 48 percent, from 34,710 in 2003 to 51,313 in 2012. Because of the cuts, however, it is not possible for the organization to fund all of the grants that would otherwise be considered.

                    While this doesn’t seem like a big deal, consider the following: In Matlin’s case, the reason his labs closed was merely because grants couldn’t be funded to keep the research going. “Investigators in those two labs had submitted grant applications to the NIH that, a few years ago, would have been funded. And now they’re not funded. There was no money to operate those labs, so several people lost their jobs.” He calls the situation “a continuous erosion,” explaining that ideally, in previous years, each moderately sized lab would be able to easily acquire two “typical” grants totaling $250,000 each. “Now, it’s exceedingly hard to get two of those grants at the same time,” he continues. “If you’re lucky, you get one. If you lose that, you have nothing.”

                    Matlin’s situation is just one of the knee-buckling ways these cuts are affecting the research community. “Over the time frame of decades, cutting funding to the NIH now can have a very devastating impact on our ability to create future interventions that could be lifesaving, life preserving, enhance quality of life, improve survival, prevent major adverse events,” Farmer says. “That [cutting funds] would be a real tragedy.”

                        Jason Brickner, Ph.D. and associate professor in molecular biosciences, understands the power of federal funding as well as any scientist in the research field. As the principle investigator at his own lab at Northwestern University, he leads research on cell biology, teaches students, distributes the budget, and pays postdoctoral fellows and research scientists. He also provides a stipend for graduate students to complete the work as outlined in his grants. During the 2013-2014 academic year, Brickner says the NIH accounted for half of his funding.

                        Alongside his wife, Donna, a fellow Ph.D. and lab manager, Brickner and his students spend their time studying how cells control the position of genes in the nucleus. Studying and understanding the organization of these genes is what enables researchers to locate and treat various diseases. But from Brickner’s perspective, the future of this kind of learning is bleak, because funding challenges are making basic scientific research progressively harder to execute in the U.S. “The fraction of grants that actually get funded is

                        so low that you have to try multiple times to get your grant funded,” he explains. Brickner says the sequester is just another tally to add to the multiple cuts of federal funding that have been increasing over recent years.

                        These cuts make Brickner pessimistic not only about the future of his lab, but also the future of his own research. “The trajectory [for the U.S.] doesn’t look good,” he says, noting that the past 40 years of innovation and discovery within the U.S. biomedical research community was made possible by federal money. Since at least the 1960s, scientific research has been universally viewed as beneficial to the nation’s economy. Lately, that has changed. This shift has left scientists similar to Brickner and Matlin running low on options for finding alternative funding.</p>

                    <p>Brickner pauses and looks down for a moment, as if to mourn a loss. He begins to discuss the current situation facing medical researchers. “More recently, spending of any kind has become a partisan issue. That is a very different situation, and it’s very difficult for academic professional societies to impact that kind of philosophical debate…and we don’t really want to become partisan players.”

                        Unfortunately, medical research has been facing judgment in the political world since at least the early 2000s when President George W. Bush restricted federally funded stem cell research. The research uses human embryos, a practice that religious conservatives opposed. President Barack Obama reinstated funding for stem cell research, but he has not been able to block the conservative fiscal movement.

                        “I would not say that the Obama administration has been successful in promoting science beyond lip service,” Brickner comments. “The reality is that things have gotten worse and continue to get worse. And now they’re as bad as they’ve been in a long time because of the sequester.”

                        But convincing the government of what makes “good science” is another hurdle entirely. Stanley Cohn, a professor of biology at DePaul University, says people search for instant gratification and immediate results. This creates an unfriendly environment for science, an industry in which conclusions from basic research studies may not be available until years later. With the absence of results, many politicians see fit to respond with an absence of funding.

                        “When there’s more focus on distinct medical issues, we lose sight of basic research that can lead to innovations in the future,” Cohn says. “There’s this sense of immediacy… There are people in the government asking, ‘What is this giving us now?’” The 16-day government shutdown in October 2013 may have seemed measly, even comical, to the general public. But it stalled the grant application process for medical researchers so severely that the NIH issued a public notice on its website.

                        “The shutdown came at one of our busiest periods,” Dr. Sally Rockey, the NIH deputy director for research, wrote on her blog. “And it is going to take some time to bring the extramural programs back to full strength.” Even in a good year, stalls in Congress can affect the sciences, and Rockey’s words are both ominous and worrisome – it could take longer than necessary for the NIH to bring its extracurricular plans back into play.

The sequester has put a tremendous amount of fiscal stress on our institution.”

                        Since as far back as World War II, the United States has dominated the medical research field with top-notch scholars of all specializations flocking to the U.S. because of its resources and prestige. That prestige and honor is now under a threat because of the competition from other nations.

                        In short, the U.S. is losing in the research race. While there are still those that come to the country to train, these students don’t necessarily rule out leaving in order to pursue science in a country where attaining a grant is more probable.

                        “In some senses, the probability of getting a grant in India is higher than in the U.S.,” explains Varun Sood, a graduate student in Brickner’s lab. “Because perhaps two decades ago, there was a boost in U.S. funding. India is going through that phase.” The fact that Sood is an international student limits the amount of grants he may apply for. Within one year, he applied for three grants, none of which were accepted. The opportunities are so few and far between that Sood hasn’t stricken the idea of a return to India from his mind, and it’s not a surprise to say that he isn’t exactly sure what to expect for his future.

                        The exodus of immigrant researchers leaving the country to move back to their native lands has far-reaching consequences for both American medical care and the economy. High-skilled immigrant workers contribute to economic growth through innovation and entrepreneurship, according to economist Kim Fraser of BBVA Compass, who co-wrote a 2013 report on immigration and economic impact. BBVA is a financial institution based out of Birmingham, Ala.

                        Data from the BBVA’s 2013 research report shows the percentage of those residing in the U.S. possessing graduate or professional degrees is higher among foreign-born than native-born students. “We need to address issues like providing incentives to keep foreign-born graduate students in the U.S. in order to keep our competitive advantage,” explains Fraser, emphasizing that this is necessary in order to increase productivity and create jobs.

                        Research shows the trend of immigrants coming to the U.S. will continue as long as they can earn more in America than anywhere else, but Fraser is pessimistic America can retain its lead. She implies the edge our country currently has in terms of competitive advantages in research could be lost. “It’s getting to the point where other countries are progressing in higher education, and students are remaining there,” she says. This loss of researchers doesn’t just mean America loses its reputation and its potential for Nobel Prize winners – it also means that the overall U.S. economy suffers.

                        According to a 2011 study from the Association of American Medical Colleges, every dollar invested in research at medical schools and teaching hospitals leads to an impact of $2.60 of economic activity. The result of this investment includes the salaries paid to high-skilled workers, such as doctors and researchers, and low-skilled workers, such as hospital orderlies.

                        “Per dollar invested, there’s a much greater return in terms of economic activity that comes from the discoveries that get made through American science,” says Brickner. For his part, he has already seen a progressive decrease in funding at the expense of other countries whose funding has experienced increases, such as China and Asia. “China has aspirations to become a leader in science and technology, and they have not historically been,” he notes. “They’re positioned to invest enough to make that change that may mean researchers leave the U.S. to go to other countries to pursue science.” He goes on to indicate that, in the future, he sees himself going wherever the funding may be.

                        “The reality is, as an academic scientist, if I don’t have grants, my job becomes very much teaching and administration,” he says. “Although I’m willing to do those things, and I enjoy teaching, that’s not my primary motivation. So, if an opportunity came along…instead of having to fight to just keep my lab afloat, if there were another, more stable funding environment, then I might choose to pursue that. I think most scientists would make the same choice.”

                        Brickner and other scientists find that their concerns are not only shaped by the shift of America’s dominance in the research field, but also by an apprehension regarding the future of the general population’s wellbeing. “The reason we should all be concerned about the cuts is, absent from the research, we will not have the healthy society we have,” warns the AAMC Chief Scientific Officer Ann C. Bonham. More than economics and skilled scientists, medical research remains at risk.

                        Take community hospitals, for example. When dealing with older patients who need an aortic valve replacement, hospitals don’t commonly employ a technique known as trans-catheter aortic valve replacement surgery, or TAVR. The procedure, approved in November 2011 by the FDA in the United States, allows doctors to place a new valve in the heart without having to perform open-heart surgery. This technique was first used experimentally at teaching hospitals associated with universities, as well as by those who had access to federal research money. The current cuts threaten procedures such as TAVR, which, without federal funding, would not exist, let alone have the ability to become widespread.

                        "I am a health policy researcher, and the emphasis on my work is trying to find efficiencies in the health care system,” Farmer says. “So the fact that my work is under threat at the time when the biggest crisis is an efficiency crisis, it just makes no sense…” He shakes his head as he brings up yet another reason why it would be an immense loss for medical research to leave this country: cancer research. “In the immediate term, if research is done in the U.S., [patients] have access to experimental treatments,” Farmer says. “If the U.S. is not playing a role in testing and experimenting with those treatments because research dollars have gone away, then your access to those experimental therapies will be less.”

                        It’s a similar situation for Bonham, who says that U.S. researchers are close to finding the genome of cancerous tumors. This discovery will lead to more effective treatments for cancer patients, but only if federal funding can sustain that research. “If [that research] goes away, that momentum will go away,” she says. “It’s like digging a thousand-foot hole that you are trying to climb out of.”

                        Farmer shares this fear, admitting that although it might be too early to tell how the cuts will impact the research, he already sees the consequences as far-reaching. “If it is a long-term trend, then yes, innovation will suffer, fewer new drugs will be developed, and problems in hospital administration will take longer to solve,” he says.

                        In the meantime, what happens when the grant money a lab depends on continues to dry up? It’s a daunting question, and one that points both American researchers and the general public towards a frightening future.

                        “What you’re really doing is cutting the amount of people who can do science,” stresses Brickner. “We’re trying to survive with less grant money, that’s strategy No. 1. Some people are choosing other careers - and in particular, of the people I train, fewer and fewer of them actually want to pursue science professionally.”

                        If the soil in science doesn’t look fertile, well-meaning professors have trouble encouraging students to pursue a career in medicine, given its unreliable future. This is the case at DePaul University, where students in Cohn’s undergraduate cellular biology courses now spend time learning the grant writing process.

                        It’s also something that Matlin sees on a regular basis. “Instead of teaching students how to be better scientists and how to do research, how to think of research problems, how to do experiments right…the teaching has turned around and focused on ‘how do I write a good grant?’ That’s not the same thing as doing research,” Matlin says.

                        Brickner is more blunt: “It’s hard for me to argue and encourage my trainees that they should pursue a career in this area,” he says.

                        “Whereas 10 years ago, it was possible to imagine that things were kind of going through a cycle of maybe slower growth…right now, I don’t feel like I can be that optimistic.”

                        Brickner instead sees this as the beginning of the end when it comes to American contributions to medicine. He definitively articulates, “I feel like, right now, we might really be in a phase where we’re kind of presiding over the end of American dominance in science.”
